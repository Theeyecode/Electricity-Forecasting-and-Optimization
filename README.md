⚡ Electricity Forecasting and Optimization with IEA Data: A Renewable Energy Strategy
This project leverages global electricity data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) alongside GDP and population data to explore, forecast, and optimize electricity consumption across countries from 2010 to 2025.

🔍 Project Overview
Goal: Predict monthly electricity consumption using economic, demographic, and production indicators, and recommend optimal energy source allocation using prescriptive analytics.

Scope: Combines exploratory data analysis, machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and optimization modeling (Google OR-Tools) to support energy policy and planning.

📊 Tools & Techniques
Python: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, pywraplp (Google OR-Tools)

Tableau: Interactive dashboards and visualizations

Data Sources: IEA Monthly Electricity Statistics, UN GDP & Population estimates

🧠 Key Highlights
Feature importance analysis to interpret energy drivers

Forecasting model with ~87% R² accuracy (XGBoost)

Linear programming model for cost-efficient energy generation (Canada case study)

Insights to support sustainable energy transition planning
